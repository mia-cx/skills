# Refine skill

Apply [agent-copy](../agent-copy/SKILL.md) in full; Read it first if not already loaded. Its pointer rules audit the description, and its skill-mechanics section audits the invocation mode. Checks specific to skills:

- **Check the invocation mode first.** A wrong mode invalidates how the description should read.
- **Fresh readers.** Describe the current workflow without relying on earlier versions. Remove negations of discarded instructions, following agent-copy's fresh-reader check.
- Model-invoked descriptions follow the template `Use when the user asks to …`, in the user's words.
- Examples are concrete and adaptable, not generic.
- Work re-derived across runs (a converter, a query, a validation) becomes `scripts/`.
- Verify tool names, flags, and paths still exist: a skill caches the world and the world moves.

When quality is contested or the description mis-triggers in practice, go empirical: run representative prompts with and without the skill and compare.
